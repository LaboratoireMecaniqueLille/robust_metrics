## Content

This repository contains 3 files:  
-**Data:** contains the images of the test cases and the mask of regularization   
-**src:** the source code  
-**Outputs:** file containing the outputs    
## Requirements

This code is GPU-accelerated and requires the following Python modules for its operation:  
- CuPy
- Cucim
- Numpy
- OpenCV
- matplotlib 
- scipy
- scikit-image

The code was tested on an NVIDIA GPU with a computing capacity >3, CUDA toolkit version >11.2, and a Python version >3.9

To initiate the computations, it is necessary to simply modify the parameters in the file **/Src/mainscript**  and execute the command **./mainscript**
